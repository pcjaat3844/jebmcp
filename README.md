## üßê Introduction

**JEBMCP** stands at the intersection of **JEB** and **MCP**. JEB is a powerful tool for decompiling and analyzing various applications, while MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack) allows you to manipulate Minecraft's source code. This project brings these two tools together, enabling users to harness their combined capabilities for advanced reverse engineering tasks.

Whether you're an experienced developer or just starting with reverse engineering, JEBMCP can provide the tools you need to enhance your projects.
